Project Name: Jenga Pesa (Swahili for "Build Money")
Tagline: Decentralized, Collateral-Lite Microlending for Africa's Gig Economy.

The Problem & Opportunity
Across Africa, millions of freelancers, gig workers, and small-scale entrepreneurs face a critical barrier: access to short-term credit. Traditional banks see them as high-risk with no formal collateral. Mobile money (like M-Pesa) allows for payments but not for credit based on future earnings. A freelance graphic designer needs a new laptop to take on a bigger project, or a delivery rider needs urgent scooter repairs, but they have to wait weeks to get paid, missing the opportunity.

The Solution: Jenga Pesa
Jenga Pesa is a DeFi protocol that provides microloans using a user's reputation and future cash flow as collateral. Instead of locking up crypto assets (which many unbanked users don't have), users can "lock" a verified stream of their future income.

Core Concept: Leverage Superfluid-style money streams and on-chain reputation to create a novel, low-collateral lending model.

How It Works (The User Journey)
Onboarding & Verification:

A gig worker connects their wallet and verifies their identity in a privacy-preserving manner (e.g., using Zero-Knowledge Proofs).

They link their digital payment accounts (e.g., Mobile Money, Paystack payout account) to create a "Verified Income Stream."

Building Reputation & "Proof of Income":

The user doesn't need to deposit money. Instead, they start a small, continuous money stream from their linked account into a Jenga Pesa smart contract. This acts as a small, verifiable "proof of income" and builds their on-chain reputation score.

This reputation score is an NFT (Soulbound Token - SBT) that represents their creditworthiness. It increases with consistent streaming and timely repayments.

Requesting a Loan:

The user requests a microloan (e.g., $50 - $500). The smart contract calculates their credit limit based on their reputation score and the size/consistency of their income stream.

The loan is disbursed in a stablecoin (e.g., cUSD for the Celo track, or a USDx on other chains) directly to their wallet.

Automated Repayment:

Repayment is seamless. Upon receiving the loan, a new, larger reverse money stream is automatically created from the user's wallet back to the protocol's treasury.

This ensures automatic, incremental repayment directly from their future earnings, making it manageable and reducing default risk.

The Lender Side (Pool):

A liquidity pool allows anyone (individuals, DAOs, impact funds) to deposit stablecoins to fund these microloans and earn interest, directly connecting global capital with local African entrepreneurs.

Why This is a Perfect Fit for EthNile'25
Innovation (Judging Criteria): It's highly original. It moves beyond over-collateralized DeFi and uses streaming money flows and SBTs in a novel way to solve a real-world problem of credit access.

Impact (Judging Criteria): Directly addresses the critical challenge of financial inclusion for Africa's massive and growing informal and gig economy.

Eligibility & Tracks:

Base Track: Built on Ethereum L2 (e.g., Base) for scalability and low fees.

Celo Track: Perfect fit. Can use Celo's mobile-first ecosystem and cUSD stablecoin for seamless integration with local economies.

Open Track: The concept is groundbreaking and uses cutting-edge Web3 primitives.

Execution & Technical Robustness:

Smart Contracts: For the lending logic, money streams, and reputation SBTs.

Frontend: A simple, mobile-friendly dApp.

Backend/Oracles: A lightweight backend to verify off-chain payment data (from mobile money APIs) and bring it on-chain as a verifiable credential.

Design & UX: The key is simplicity. The complex crypto mechanics happen in the background. The user only sees: "Connect Account -> Build Reputation -> Get Loan -> Repay Automatically."

Sustainability: Has a clear path to real-world adoption. It creates a sustainable economic model where lenders earn yield, and borrowers get life-changing capital. It could easily evolve into a full-fledged startup.

Hackathon Deliverables
GitHub Repo: Open-source code for the smart contracts and frontend.

Working Demo (Deployed on Testnet):

A live dApp on the Celo Alfajores Testnet and/or Base Sepolia.

Demonstrate: user onboarding, starting an income stream, reputation NFT minting, loan request, and the creation of the repayment stream.

5-Minute Demo Video: A screen recording walking through the user flow, explaining the problem, and showcasing the live demo.

In summary, Jenga Pesa is not just another DeFi protocol; it's a socially impactful, technologically innovative project that uses the unique properties of Web3 to build a more inclusive financial system for Africa, perfectly aligning with the spirit of EthNile.
